# Retrospective Revision app for those who forget
This is a retrospective revision application made for students who forget stuff
they read. While studying psychology I got to learn that forgetting is actually
retrieval failure. When we learn a certain thing, it stays in our long term
memory. But most of the time we either do not process the information is a
semantic manner or we do not get the right cues required to get those memory.

Another thing that I find fascinating is how we can think of our memory system
similar to a computers memory. For example, we can think of our long term memory
similar to hard disk in our computer. Furthermore short term memory similar to
RAM. So, when we try to memorize a line we load it into our short term memory
from sensory memory and if it stays long enough it goes into the long term.

# Distinctiveness and Complexity:

Here a user adds a task, it will include that task into to revision tasks to the
next (7, 14, 21, 28)th day relative to the day that task was added.

Going through the same topic in an interval will help students and other
professionals to remember it far more precisely with a clear understanding.
